#Cloudlets

The cloud is a global phenomenon. We make use of cloud services because they provide us with
unique ways to collaborate, stay in touch, and engage with media socially. Such services have done
wonders to connect, and make sharing easier for, people across the globe. The cloud computing
paradigm has enabled a company such as WhatsApp to scale to 18M users and handle spikes in
demand.

Such is the reach of the cloud computing paradigm that it also affects t
he design and implementation of wireless access points, whose purpose is no longer to interconnect devices but to
connect them to the internet and the cloud. For instance, it is not possible to create a wireless
access point to share files locally on current mobile platforms without also sharing your 3G internet
connection. But at the same time we, as Computer Scientists, know that using cloud services is an
outright inefficient way of sharing files with the person next to you.

The aim of this project is to run the same technologies that power WhatsApp, namely webservers, data stores, and
databases at a smaller scale on embedded systems, such as the Raspberry Pi. Thus, transforming the cloud from a global panopticon
to a hyper-localized, ad-hoc instantiations of the cloud: a cloudlet in short
