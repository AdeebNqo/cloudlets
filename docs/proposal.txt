Introduction
------------

In 2001, Kraut et al [6] coined the term “strong ties”. This was to refer to the things which strengthen
human relationships such as frequent contact, and deep feelings of affection and obligation. This project
aims to investigate the use of mobile devices and cloudlets that can also be used to strengthen human relationships.
Cloud computing has been a powerful computing paradigm which has changed the way we deliver services to users.
We make use of cloud services because they provide us with unique ways to collaborate, stay in touch, and engage with media
socially. These services have been used to connect and make sharing easier for people across the globe.
The same technologies that power cloud service providers, namely web servers, data stores, and
databases, can also run at a smaller scale on embedded systems, such as the Raspberry Pi. Computer
hobbyists have revealed that the Raspberry Pi could make as an attractive solution for a small
lightweight server because of its solid state storage, no noise, small form factor and low power
consumption[4]. This project aims to make use of a Raspberry Pi extended with a battery, WiFi radio
and local storage to provide a group of co-located friends with opportunities to share and engage
with media amongst themselves. These cloudlets can be used to exhange files, document collaboration, in essence,
for all cloud services on a lower scale. The advantage being less network latency. This research is interested in the
Human-computer interaction aspects, that is, which services can be offered to enhance co-located device use.

	-------------------
	Research questions
	-------------------

	1. Is an embedded system viable for creating cloudlets considering battery use, etc?
	2. When users are given control over their data, lucid privacy control, etc -- do they
	consider cloudlets usable to enhance co-located use.

	-------------
	Significance
	-------------
	The significance of this project is that it will continue on the work done by Reitmaier & Benz. They have shown
	that people believe that cloudlet can be effective, however, they have concerns over privancy, data control, etc.
	This project will address those, an then evaluate cloudlets to see if they are fully viable for enhancing co-located use.
	In addition, they will test the feasibility of using embedded systems as the backbone of a cloudlet. If they are feasible,
	this will mean people can easily buy portable "devices" to help them connect to each other.

Literature review
------------------

Cloudlets are relatively new in research, as such, they have been under the microscope as a number of researchers have consider using
them for computation offloading. The literature that has been studied focuses on offloading computation, co-located device use, file sharing
in ad-hoc network for mobile devices, providing collaboration services for mobile devices.

We have observed online media sharing become popular with the advent
of services such as Dropbox, Google+, Google Drive, etc. Walton et al[16] have shown, however,
that in places such as Khayelitsha (Cape Town, South Africa), co-located phone use surpassed online sharing.
The media stored on the mobile devices became public personae, that is, played the role of social media 'profiles'[16].
Trends in the use of technology is highly dependant on the infrastructure at our disposal.<highlight trust models, begin with
how tech use is different based on geo region then mention walton next.>

Methodology
------------

The project has been segmented into front-end and back-end. The front-end is an Android application. Naturally, it's goal is
provide an abstraction of the data control and sharing logic. The aim to is to setup focus groups to test the viability of the front-end.
Viability, being how intuitive and responsive is the application.
