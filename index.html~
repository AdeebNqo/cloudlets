<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are cloudlet?</h3>

<p>The cloud is a global phenomenon. We make use of cloud services because they provide us with unique ways to collaborate, stay in touch, and engage with media socially. Such services have done wonders to connect, and make sharing easier for, people across the globe. The cloud computing paradigm has enabled a company such as WhatsApp to scale to 18M users and handle spikes in demand.

Such is the reach of the cloud computing paradigm that it also affects t he design and implementation of wireless access points, whose purpose is no longer to interconnect devices but to connect them to the internet and the cloud. For instance, it is not possible to create a wireless access point to share files locally on current mobile platforms without also sharing your 3G internet connection. But at the same time we, as Computer Scientists, know that using cloud services is an outright inefficient way of sharing files with the person next to you.

The aim of this project is to run the same technologies that power WhatsApp, namely webservers, data stores, and databases at a smaller scale on embedded systems, such as the Raspberry Pi. Thus, transforming the cloud from a global panopticon to a hyper-localized, ad-hoc instantiations of the cloud: a cloudlet in short.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
