Getting started
================



There are two components at play here.
	- The written source code
	- The mqtt broker

Installation
-------------

The very first thing is to make sure that `python-mosquitto` and `mosquitto` (the broker)
are installed. We will assume that the reader is using of a Linux Ubuntu Box.

TO install the packages, follow the following instructions:

Open terminal and execute the following cmds
1. sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mosquitto-dev/mosquitto-ppa
2. sudo apt-get update
3. sudo apt-get install python-mosquitto mosquitto

Running cloudlet
----------------

The first to do is make sure that the following services are running:
1. isc-dhcp-server
2. hostapd

We will assume that the reader is knows how to configure the settings for these services to
function properly. The files to be tweaked are 
	- /etc/network/interfaces
	- /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
	- /etc/dhcp/dhcp.conf

When they are running, one should start the mosquitto broker as follows:

`mosquitto -p <port here>`

Once that has been done, the source code can be started through the main entry either main.py or driver.py
