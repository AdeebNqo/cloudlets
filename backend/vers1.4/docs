Plugin development
==================

The services all should be under the folder
'/services/'. When you create a new service
called 'myservice' for instance. Create a folder
under the services folder that looks like this:
	myservice
		->description.txt
		->__init__.py

The description file is a description of your
service. It also contains your contact information.
Here's a sample a description file:

	Name=myservice
	CloudletV=1.4
	Description=A test service that prints hello.
	Authors=Andile Uyeva <uyeva@linuxanyone.com>
	Copyright=Copyright Â© 2007 Andile Uyeva
	Website=http://andileuyeva.com/

These fields are the only ones allowed, all others will be
ignored. Also, it is good practice to name your service folder
with the same name of the service for the users' convience.
Each service should have two methods:

	1. start()
	2. stop()
